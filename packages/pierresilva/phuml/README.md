phUML is a fully automatic [UML][uml] class diagram generator written in [PHP][php].
It creates a class diagram from an OO codebase based on the UML specification.

## Installation

### PHAR

We distribute a PHP Archive [(PHAR)][phar] that has all required dependencies of phUML bundled in a single file.
The PHAR file is signed with an openssl private key.
You will need the pubkey file to be stored beside the PHAR file at all times in order to use it.

To install `phuml` run the following commands in your terminal.

```bash
$ wget https://montealegreluis.com/phuml/phuml.phar
$ wget https://montealegreluis.com/phuml/phuml.phar.pubkey
```

Run the PHAR to see all the available commands and options

```bash
$ php phuml.phar
```

### Composer

Alternatively, you may use [Composer][composer] to download and install phUML as well as its dependencies.

```
$ composer require phuml/phuml
```
