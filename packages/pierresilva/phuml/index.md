phUML is a fully automatic [UML][uml] class diagram generator written [PHP][php].
It creates a class diagram from an OO codebase based on the UML specification.

To successfully create UML diagrams with phUML you will need to install the [graphviz][graphviz] toolkit.

phUML will use either `neato` or `dot` commands to create class diagrams.

## How does it look like?
